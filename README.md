## 📌 Project Overview

This project highlights my role as the **electrical co-lead** of the University of Miami’s **ASME Lunabotics team** for the **2024 NASA Lunabotics Competition** — a nationally recognized challenge that tasks university teams with designing and building autonomous lunar excavators capable of navigating and collecting regolith in a simulated lunar environment.

Without hesitation, the **2024 season marked a pivotal turning point** for our team. We built multiple subsystems entirely from scratch, including the complete **electrical subsystem**.

We prioritized **simplicity and reliability**, focusing on minimizing points of failure while ensuring robust performance in harsh simulated lunar conditions. The rover operated flawlessly during competition.

## ▶️ How to Run

> _Instructions for replicating or simulating the system (if applicable)._

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nasa-lunabotics-2024-electrical.git


* A **diagram** or image of the electrical system
* Sections for **Setup**, **Hardware List**, or **Team Credits**
* A **"Tech Stack"** or component list (e.g., Arduino, CAN transceivers, motor drivers, etc.)

I'm happy to build out the full `README.md` with more sections if you'd like!
