## üìåProject Overview

This project highlights main work done by the electrical team of the University of Miami‚Äôs **ASME Lunabotics** for the **2024 NASA Lunabotics Competition** ‚Äî a nationally recognized challenge that tasks university teams with designing and building autonomous lunar excavators capable of navigating and collecting regolith in a simulated lunar environment.

Without hesitation, the **2024 season marked a pivotal turning point** for the team. We built multiple subsystems entirely from scratch, including the complete **electrical subsystem**.
In the design process, we prioritized **simplicity and reliability**, focusing on minimizing points of failure while ensuring high performance in harsh simulated lunar conditions.

## üíª CAN Bus System


The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is a communication protocol designed for real-time data exchange between electronic devices over a single pair of wires called CAN LOW and the other called CAN HI. Unlike traditional point-to-point serial communication, CAN uses a multi-master architecture where each node (or device) can transmit and receive messages without a central host. Messages are prioritized by IDs, enabling critical data to take precedence during high-traffic periods. CAN also includes error-checking mechanisms like CRC and automatic retransmission, ensuring communication integrity even in electrically noisy environments.  In our rover, the CAN bus linked the **Raspberry Pi** to multiple **Raspberry Pi Pico**, enabling efficient communication of data from sensors and motor encoders. We used CAN bus to reduce the computational load on the main microcontroller, allowing us to distribute this load on multiple nodes. In addition, the CAN bus allowed us to reduce the wire complexity. We used the CAN module **MCP2515** that communicates with the microcontrollers via the SPI and then sends the data through the CAN H and CAN L wires. Note: In this configration, we used the CAN classic 2.0 with data rate of 500 kbit/s.

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Use `loopback=True` first to test.
- When connecting to a real CAN bus, set `loopback=False` and `silent=False`.
- Make sure SPI pins match your Pico‚Äôs pinout.

## üß©Motor drivers (Sabertooth 2x12)
The Sabertooth 2x12 is a versatile, dual-channel motor driver designed to control two DC motors with up to 12‚ÄØA continuous current per channel. It supports multiple control modes, including analog, radio control (RC), and serial communication.
### You can not plug the Raspberry pi directly to the Sabertooth.
One of the challenges we faced was the voltage incompatibility between the **Raspberry Pi**, which operates at 3.3V logic, and the Sabertooth motor driver, which requires 5V logic for reliable serial communication. In the 2023 competition, the team addressed this issue by routing control signals through an **Arduino**, which acted as a 5V buffer. While this worked, it introduced unnecessary complexity and potential communication delays. To make the system simpler and reduce the points of failure, we transitioned to using compact **bi-directional logic level converters (BSS138)**, allowing us to safely and efficiently shift the 3.3V signals up to 5V. This solution maintained signal integrity and enabled direct communication between the Pi and the Sabertooth.

### Sabertooth 2x12 Motor Driver Configuration

To reduce the wiring complexity, the serial mode was used. This explains how to set up the **Sabertooth 2x12** motor driver for **packetized serial mode** with default DIP switch settings and configurable address bits.

üìÑ [Official Sabertooth 2x12 Datasheet (PDF)](https://www.dimensionengineering.com/datasheets/Sabertooth2x12.pdf)


### ‚úÖ Fixed DIP Switch Settings (#1‚Äì#3)

Always make sure the first three DIP switches are set as follows:

| Switch | Position | Purpose                   |
|:------:|:--------:|---------------------------|
| 1      | DOWN     | Serial mode enabled       |
| 2      | DOWN     | Baud rate set to 9600 bps |
| 3      | UP       | Address bit (fixed)       |


### üîÑ Configurable DIP Switches (#4‚Äì#6)

Use switches **#4‚Äì#6** to set the **serial address**.  
These switches work together with Switch #3 (which is always UP) to define the final address. The documentation above has detailed configration for these switches.

### üîß Sample code for testing

To test the motors, we wrote a script using the `pysabertooth` library. Each Sabertooth was initialized with a unique address. This script demonstrates safe testing under current limitations and includes logic for bidirectional control.

```python
from pysabertooth import Sabertooth

# Initialize Sabertooth motor driver on address 128
motor1 = Sabertooth("/dev/serial0", baudrate=9600, address=128)
motor1.open()
motor1.drive(1, 60)  # Drive motor 1 at 60% power
motor1.drive(2, 60)  # Drive motor 2 at 60% power
```

## üß©Motor drivers (BTS7960)

The BTS7960 is a high-power H-bridge motor driver module capable of driving DC motors with currents up to 43A. This motor driver support speed and direction control via PWM signals. These drivers had beem used to control the linear actuators.

| **Pin Name**    | **Description**                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **L\_EN**       | Left side enable pin (enable left half-bridge)    |
| **R\_EN**       | Right side enable pin (enable right half-bridge)  |
| **L\_PWM**      | Left side PWM input (controls direction/speed)    |
| **R\_PWM**      | Right side PWM input (controls direction/speed)   |
| **RPWM / LPWM** | Alternative labeling for direction control inputs |
| **VCC**         | 5V logic power input                              |
| **GND**         | Ground                                            |
| **Motor+**      | Motor positive terminal                           |
| **Motor-**      | Motor negative terminal                           |
| **B+**          | Battery positive (motor power input)              |
| **B-**          | Battery negative (ground)                         |

If you want to reduce the wiring complexity, you can just PULL L_EN, R_EN, and VCC to be high, and then you can easily control the speed of the actuator by the PWM from only two pins from the PI.
