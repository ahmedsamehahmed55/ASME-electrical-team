## 📌 Project Overview

This project highlights my role as the **electrical co-lead** of the University of Miami’s **ASME Lunabotics team** for the **2024 NASA Lunabotics Competition** — a nationally recognized challenge that tasks university teams with designing and building autonomous lunar excavators capable of navigating and collecting regolith in a simulated lunar environment.

Without hesitation, the **2024 season marked a pivotal turning point** for our team. We built multiple subsystems entirely from scratch, including the complete **electrical subsystem**.

We prioritized **simplicity and reliability**, focusing on minimizing points of failure while ensuring robust performance in harsh simulated lunar conditions. The rover operated flawlessly during competition.
