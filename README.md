# 🚀 NASA Lunabotics 2024 – Electrical Subsystem

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository showcases my role as the **electrical co-lead** of the University of Miami’s **ASME Lunabotics team** for the **2024 NASA Lunabotics Competition** — a nationally recognized challenge that tasks university teams with designing and building autonomous lunar excavators capable of navigating and collecting regolith in a simulated lunar environment.

Without hesitation, the **2024 season marked a pivotal turning point** for our team. We built multiple subsystems entirely from scratch, including the complete **electrical subsystem**.

As co-lead of the electrical team, I was responsible for:

* ⚡ Designing and implementing the rover’s electrical architecture
* 🔌 Power distribution system design
* 🧠 Motor driver selection and integration
* 📡 Sensor interfacing and real-time data communication
* 🛠️ PCB design and hardware testing
* 🛜 Implementing **CAN communication** between subsystems

We prioritized **simplicity and reliability**, keeping the system as robust and streamlined as possible. Our focus on minimizing points of failure and applying systems engineering principles led to a highly functional rover with no major issues during the competition.

## 🏆 Achievements

Our efforts were recognized with multiple awards:

* 🏅 **Leaps and Bounds Award** – for significant improvements in systems engineering
* 🥉 **3rd Place in Presentation and Demonstration**
* ⚡ **Most Energy-Efficient Team**

* A **diagram** or image of the electrical system
* Sections for **Setup**, **Hardware List**, or **Team Credits**
* A **"Tech Stack"** or component list (e.g., Arduino, CAN transceivers, motor drivers, etc.)

I'm happy to build out the full `README.md` with more sections if you'd like!
